~ Event Handling: Simon games require handling various types of events such as mouse clicks or taps . By building this game, you'll gain hands-on experience in attaching event listeners, handling user input, and responding to different types of events.

~ Event Delegation: As the game involves multiple buttons, you can explore the concept of event delegation. Instead of attaching event listeners to each individual button, you can use event delegation to handle events on a parent element.
